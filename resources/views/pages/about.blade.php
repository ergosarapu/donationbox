                    <p>This is a web application for generating links to direct or regular donation forms for
                        {{$cc}}n and international payment methods. The app allows you to create your own virtual donation box
                        for donations without having to write code or link your website or app to contracts and
                        integrations with banklink.</p> <br> <p>
                        We provide a convenient interface for donors so that they don't have to enter data manually
                        or copy it. The donor only has to follow a link by scanning a QR-code or going to a
                        direct URL-address, enter the amount of donation, choose the transfer type - one-time or regular payment (single or standing order), and choose your bank, Paypal or credit card payment type.</p>

                        Currently connecting solutions related to accepting donations is either quite difficult for a
                        person who does not have technical skills, or has a monthly fee, which may be inappropriate
                        in cases where the collection is organized by a private person or an NGO that does not have
                        regular donors.<br><br>
                        We believe it is important to make organizing fundraisers in {{$cc}} a quick, convenient,
                        and, most importantly, fee free method for fundraisers.

                        DonationBox is just an intermediary that sends a request to your bank's web page with the
                        account number, the name of the recipient, an explanation, and the amount of the payment. The
                        bank chosen by the user is responsible for the security of the transfer and all actions
                        related to user authentication.<br><br>

                        According to all modern standards, we use a secure SSL connection, but we advise you to use
                        additional data encryption tools such as incognito mode, VPN, etc. for anonymity.

                                are read by the DonationBox application. Parameters

                        According to various international regulations, banks in {{$cc}} and other countries are
                        obliged to monitor payments in real time and ensure that no suspicious transactions pass
                        through them. Otherwise, the bank has the right to freeze funds for transfer from your bank
                        account until the investigation is completed. Therefore, be honest and state the real purpose
                        for the transfer in the explanation. <br><br>

                        The UID token is necessary for initiating payments in SEB's online bank. This way SEB
                        improves the security of pre-filled forms on the payment transfer pages.<br><br>
                        UID can be received by both individuals and legal entities. Please note that the
                        person representing a legal entity must be a member of the board. To get the UID, you
                        need to send a free-form application with a request for UID to the email: <a

                        DonationBox is available for Swedbank (EE, LV, LT), SEB (EE, LV, LT), LHV (EE), Coop (EE). All of them support one-time and
                        recurring payments. We hope that this list may be expanded in the future.

                        Each DonationBox page has a field with a code for an automatically generated widget.
                        Copy this code and paste it into the HTML code of your page.<br><br>

                @slot('cardContent')
                        Currently the service works only with local IBAN accounts. In the near future the logic for European payments through {{$cc}}n banks will be finalized.

                @slot('cardContent')
                        Yes, it is possible. Just leave the IBAN field blank and the selection with {{$cc}}n banks will not appear on the donation form.

                @slot('cardContent')
                        You can choose between these two payment types for bank methods except Revolut and Paypal. You can set the regular donation interval on your bank's payment transfer page.

                        Shortly, no, if you donate through local banks, Revolut or Paypal.<br><br>

                        Your name as well as bank details such as IBAN account can be seen by the recipient of the funds. In fact,
                        this is the same as would be the case with a manual direct transfer of funds through your
                        online bank.<br><br>

                        Currently, the only method to connect anonymous payments is to use the Donorbox.org service that you can
                        also connect to DonationBox. You can read more about anonymous donations at Donorbox.org FAQ page: <a
